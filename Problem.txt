A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month, and the amount of state and county sales tax collected. The state sales tax rate is 5 percent and the county sales tax rate is 6 percent. Create a GUI application that allows the user to enter the total sales for the month into a text field. From this figure, the application should calculate and display the following:


The amount of county sales tax


The amount of state sales tax


The total sales tax (county plus state)


In the applicationâ€™s code, represent the county tax rate (0.06) and the state tax rate (0.05) as named constants.
